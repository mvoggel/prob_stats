**Project: Interactive Statistics & Probability Course**

### **Overview**
This project is a web-based **Statistics & Probability Explorer**, designed to help users understand key statistical concepts through visualizations, explanations, and interactive elements. The tool will be mostly **static** (prebuilt components) rather than dynamically processing user data, making it easier to develop and deploy within a couple of weeks. The long-term vision is for this to serve as the foundation for a **college-level statistics course**.

### **Goals & Purpose**
- Showcase knowledge in **statistics, probability, and Bayesian statistics**.
- Serve as an **educational tool** that could be sold or used as a curriculum component.
- Keep complexity manageable by focusing on **static but informative** content.

### **Tech Stack**
- **Frontend:** React (for UI development)
- **Backend:** Flask (Python for data processing and API)
- **Data Processing & Visualization:** Python (Flask API for precomputed stats), D3.js or Chart.js for graphs
- **Hosting & Deployment:** GitHub & GitHub Pages (for frontend), Render/Heroku (for Flask backend)

### **Core Features**
#### **1. Probability Distributions**
- Static visualizations for:
  - Normal Distribution
  - Binomial Distribution
  - Poisson Distribution
- Explanations of parameters (mean, standard deviation, etc.)

#### **2. Statistical Concepts**
- **Central Limit Theorem:** Precomputed visualization of how sample sizes affect distributions.
- **Law of Large Numbers:** Static example showing averages converging to expected values.
- **Hypothesis Testing:** Step-by-step breakdown of t-tests and p-values.
- **Regression Analysis:** Example dataset showcasing linear regression.

#### **3. Bayesian Statistics**
- Introduction to **Bayesian Inference**.
- **Bayesâ€™ Theorem:** Explanation and real-world applications.
- **Prior, Likelihood, and Posterior Distributions**.
- **Bayesian vs. Frequentist Statistics**.

#### **4. Case Studies & Real-World Examples**
- Preloaded datasets with insights (e.g., sports stats, finance, demographics).
- Guided analysis showing how statistics and Bayesian methods apply in various fields.

#### **5. Downloadable Resources**
- PDFs of explanations and sample exercises.
- Code snippets for running statistical and Bayesian tests in Python.

### **Development Roadmap (2 Weeks)**
1. **Week 1:**
   - Set up the project repo and base UI layout in **React**.
   - Build **static pages** for each statistical concept.
   - Create precomputed **charts & graphs** using Python & JavaScript.

2. **Week 2:**
   - Implement **Flask API** for data retrieval and calculations.
   - Finalize all case studies & dataset examples.
   - Polish UI and add interactive elements (sliders, hover effects, tooltips).
   - Test deployment on **GitHub Pages (frontend) & Render/Heroku (backend)**.
   
### **Future Enhancements (Post-Launch Ideas)**
- Add **interactive quizzes**.
- Enable **CSV uploads** for user-driven analysis.
- Expand Bayesian models with **Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)**.
